### Additional notes:

Not all Windows voices may be available. However, Microsoft David Desktop and Microsoft Zira Desktop (the Windows default voices) should be available.

When casting to multiple devices a small delay is used to better align when playing starts across all devices. Even so, the audio on all devices may not be perfectly aligned.

Cast can send the video and audio of an .mp4 file stored on your computer to your chromecast device, and as well its associated audio to your PC Speakers or Google Assistant devices

Cast can send the video and audio of an .mp4 web file (url) to your chromecast device, but does not support sending the audio to your PC Speakers or Google Devices
